# Galaxy-Evolution-Data
This also a part of my old repository which comes under my scientifc coding
We will simulate a dataset of galaxies with properties like star formation rate, morphological type, and local density.Each Galaxy will have some random values for Star Formation Rate (SFR), Local density. We will also try to calculate averages like average SFR,local density.
At the end we will visualize the data, plotting a scatter plot of Local Density vs SFR with colors representing morphological types.
